# StegoShield

This project is a simple full‑stack steganography tool built with Node.js, Express, and a lightweight frontend. It allows users to hide and extract secret messages inside images.

---

## How to Run the Project

### 1. Install Dependencies

Make sure you have Node.js 18+ installed.


### 2. Set Up Environment Variables

Add the following environment variables (via Vercel dashboard or .env.local):


### 3. Run Database Migrations

Execute the SQL scripts in the `/scripts` folder to set up your database tables.

### 4. Start the Development Server


Server will start on:
http://localhost:3000

## How Steganography Works

- Image pixels are modified using LSB (Least Significant Bit) technique to hide text
- Hidden messages can be extracted by reversing the encoding process
- AI steganalysis tool detects potential hidden content in images
- Secure password protection for decoding operations
